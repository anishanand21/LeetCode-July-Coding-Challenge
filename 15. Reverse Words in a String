Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

Example 1:
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:
Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        stringstream in(s);
        string word;
        s = "";
        while (in >> word) {
            reverse(word.begin(), word.end());
            s += word + " ";
        }
        if (!s.empty()) {
            s.pop_back();
            reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        }
        return s;
    }
